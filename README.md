# Education-Census-Data
Manipulating and creating SQLite databases with beginner and intermediate queries

Project from Codecademy;

Project Objectives:

Your advice is needed by a team of policymakers seeking to make more informed decisions on education.
Help them investigate how external factors may influence performance in state assessments exams for public high school students.

Project Tasks:

•	Beginner queries

1.	How many public high schools are in each zip code? in each state?
2.	The locale_code column in the high school data corresponds to various levels of urbanization as listed below. Use the CASE statement to display the
	corresponding locale_text and locale_size in your query result.

	LOCALE_TEXT   LOCALE_CODE(LOCALE_SIZE)
	--------------------------------------
	CITY	      11(Large), 12(Midsize), 13(Small)
	SUBURB	      21(Large), 22(Midsize), 23(Small)
	TOWN	      31(Large), 32(Midsize), 33(Small)
	RURAL	      41(Large), 42(Midsize), 43(Small)
	-----------------------------------------------
	
3.	What is the minimum, maximum, and average median_household_income of the nation? For each state?
4.	Do characteristics of the zip-code area, such as median household income, influence student's performance in high school?

•	Intermediate queries

1.	On average, do students perform better on the math or reading exam? Find the number of states where students do better on the math exam,
	and vice versa.
